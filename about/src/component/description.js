            <p>This Website is mainly made for supporting the local business. The pandemic has deeply ruptured the economy of Nepal. The time is especially difficult for those who 
                used to base their livelihood on local business. The prolonged pandemic has failed the sales-income equation for these businesses. Our website seeks to uplift the
                situation for those people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through our website, not only people who run proper homestays but also those who can welcome some guests to their house, can share their details and through this website
                interested travellers could connect with them.
